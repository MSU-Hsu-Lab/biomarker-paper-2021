# biomarker-paper-2021
Public reference code for the paper _Machine Learning Prediction of Blood and Urine Biomarkers from Genotype and of Disease Risk from Biomarkers in the UK Biobank_.

## Disclaimer
The code is not self-contained, is not runnable as is, hardly commented and none of the research data is included. It is published here as a supporting reference for the paper and not as a piece of functioning software. The notebook relies on early versions of MSU-Hsu-Lab packages which, at the time of publishing the paper, were not yet public. Those packages may or may not have been published since then and the reader is recommended to check out the other lab repositories if functionalities "hidden" in imported modules are of interest. Since this code is published really _as is_, any questions about it or the methodology are welcome by the corresponding authors.
